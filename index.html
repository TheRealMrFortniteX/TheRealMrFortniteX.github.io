  <p>The DevGam was the first ever model of the game. Nobody <br> knew it existed until 2018 when TinyBuild Games announced it. <br> The Prototype was annouced in 2016 as the first trailer for the game. <br> You can actually play it if your Hello
    Neighbor game allows mods.</p>

  <p>The Hello Neighbor Pre-Alpha was the first model people could play.<br> Both the Pre-Alpha and Alpha 1 had a nighmare. In the Pre-Alpha use could use the nighmare for a glitch by getting a trash can from the neighbor's house and then put it on
    the players bed. In Hello Neighbor Alpha 1 gave us some more info about why we were sneaking in to the neighbor's house. Alpha 1.5 was never released so we don't know anything about it. Alpha 2 was a huge update!!! How Huge you ask? Well it
    eventually became Act 1 one of Hello Neighbor. Alpha 3 was another huge update because it became Act 3.
    Alpha 4 was the same as Alpha 3 except it became beta 2.
